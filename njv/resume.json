	"statement": "My name is Noah Varland and I am a sophomore at Highlands High School. I have been doing theater for about 2 years now, and continue to take theater classes with Jason Burgess. I have done 7 full length productions, as well as 2 One acts, and have worked with Highlands and CAST multiple times. I consider myself dedicated, and willing to do anything asked of me. I will always come to a rehearsal or performance prepared and ready to give it my all. I have performed in a variety of ways, I have killed, rapped, roared, and even eaten on stage. I have also done duo improv in the past, so if something were to go wrong, I can usually find a way to stay focused, and just keep going. I have also been nominated for a Cappie award for my performance as Tobias Ragg in Sweeney Todd. Although I didnâ€™t win, I consider a nomination to be a very special, once in a lifetime opportunity.",
