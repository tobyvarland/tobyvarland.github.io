	"statement": "Hello! My name is Noah Varland, and I am a current sophomore at Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, KY. I first got involved with theatre in middle school, and throughout high school I have had the opportunity to appear on stage, work on the crew, and take theatre classes. I am a dedicated thespian, willing to do anything asked of me and committed to always showing up to rehearsals and performances prepared and ready to give it my all. Outside of theatre, I also participate in KHSSL competitive speach events, including improvisational duo, a skill that benefits me as an actor as well. I have been cast in named roles in award winning shows and in smaller roles in student written shows, and I strive to embrace the unique challenges and opportunities that come with each role.",
